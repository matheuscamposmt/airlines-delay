## Solution Strategy
**Step 01. Data Description**: In this first section the data will be collected and studied. The missing values will be treated or removed. Finally, a initial data description will carried out to know the data. Therefore some calculations of descriptive statistics will be made, such as kurtosis, skewness, media, fashion, median and standard deviation.

**Step 02. Feature Engineering**: In this section, a mind map will be created to assist in the creation of the hypothesis and new features. These assumptions will help in exploratory data analysis and may improve the model scores.

**Step 03. Data Filtering**: Data filtering removes columns or rows that are not part of the business. For example, columns with customer ID, hash code or rows with age that does not consist of human age.

**Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis**: The exploratory data analysis section consists of univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis to assist in understanding of the database. The hypothesis created in step 02 will be tested in the bivariate analysis.

**Step 05. Data Preparation**: In this fifth section, the data will be prepared for machine learning modeling. Therefore, they will be transformed to improve the learning of the machine learning model, thus they can be encoded, oversampled, subsampled, or rescaled.

**Step 06. Feature Selection**: After the data preparation in this section algorithms, like Boruta, will select the best columns to be used for the training of the machine learning model. This reduces the dimensionality of the database and decreases the chances of overfitting.

**Step 07. Machine Learning Modeling**: Step 07 aims to train the machine learning algorithms and how they can predict the data. For validation, the model is trained, validated, and applied to cross-validation to know the learning capacity of the model.

**Step 08. Hyparameter Fine Tuning**: First, select the best model to be applied in the project, it's important to make a fine-tuning of the parameters to improve the performance. The same model performance methods applied in step 07 are used.
**Step 09. Conclusions**: This is a conclusion stage in which the generation capacity model is tested using unseen data. In addition, some business questions are answered to show the applicability of the model in the business context.
